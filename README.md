## COVIDGR 1.0

Under a close collaboration with an expert radiologist team of the Hospital Universitario San Cecilio, the COVIDGR-1.0 dataset of patients' anonymized X-ray images has been built. 754 images have been collected following a strict labeling protocol. They are categorized into 377 positive cases and 377 negative cases. Positive images correspond to patients who have been tested positive for COVID-19 using RT-PCR within a time span of at most 24h between the X-ray image and the test. Every image has been taken using the same type of equipment and with the same format: only the posterior-anterior view is considered.
